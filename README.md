# Rewriting History With Git

Slides for a talk on the many ways to rewrite history of a git repository.

## Talk Description

Git is an amazing tool for version control. One can get a lot done with only a few commands â€” commit, merge, pull, and push.

But Git is much more powerful than these few commands! Did you know you can remove accidentally-committed files? Include only a few specific commits from another branch? Reorder commits? Combine multiple commits into one?

This talk will get you comfortable with the more advanced features of Git. We'll dig into Git internals to understand how it tracks the entire history of your codebase, and what happens when you make a commit.

Then we'll rewrite history together. We'll talk through many scenarios where you might want to revise your commit history. You'll learn the exact commands needed to achieve mastery of your Git log.
