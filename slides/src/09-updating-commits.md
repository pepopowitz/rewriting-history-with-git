### Working with someone who also made changes?

It can be done.

One of you pushes, the other gets their commits back onto the branch via merging/rebasing/cherry-picking

TODO: show them how to do this?

### Resolution

#### `git commit --amend`

Notes:

- amends the previous commit
- including SHA!
  - That SHA is a fingerprint of the code in its current state, so if that state changed, so did the SHA
- add/stage things before running the command,
  - or add the -a flag
