# Updating Commits

## I committed something but it was not quite right.

Trail: Updating commits

## !!!Danger zone!!!!

Be cautious when commits have been pushed to others!

- if they have started more work based on that commit, things get real bad!!!
- if they haven't started any work, they will probably want to delete the branch before re-fetching it.
