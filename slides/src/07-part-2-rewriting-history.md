Notes:

with a deeper understanding of git, we're ready for our second goal of the day:

becoming more comfortable with rewriting history

Trail: Rewriting History

## How we're going to get there

### With a console

### With a phone booth

Notes:

I used to be scared of it too

...

that's right, we're going to time travel in a phone booth, like some of the greatest heroes in the history of mankind

Trail: Rewriting History, Setting The Scene

Notes:

I apologize for using a movie from 1989 iin this talk

but I am old and it's what I know

If there's an appropriate replacement made more recently, pretend that's what I'm talking about.

Trail: Rewriting History, Setting The Scene

IMAGE: plot summary

Notes:

a quick plot summary for those who were not born until 10 years after this classic:

two high school students named bill & ted are in danger of flunking their history final,

which we find out would be catastrophic

as their awful garage band named wyld stallyns (spelled like that)

goes on to form the basis of a utopian society hundreds of years in the future.

to pass their final, a guy from that future society named rufus brings them a time-travelling phone booth

so they can learn about history

instead of learning about history, they steal historical figures and bring them back to their history final in 1989.

and hilarity ensues.
