## Why are we here?

### Git is scary

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:

Trying new things is scary.

Trying new things _with Git_ is extra scary.

There are high stakes: if I mess up my Git history, I've lost all my work!

That would not only make me angry and sad, it would set me back a couple days and force me to redo stuff.

So it's pretty easy to justify playing it safe and sticking to the things we know how to do.

Commit, push, pull. Commit, push, pull. Commit, push, pull.

...

but There's so much more to Git than `commit`, `push`, `pull`

...

One of my favorite things to with git is rewrite history

And there are very very many ways to do that
