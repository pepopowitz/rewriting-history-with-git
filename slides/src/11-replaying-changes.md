this will select a commit from anywhere in your log, and apply it to the end of your current branch

## !!!Danger zone!!!!

IMAGE: DANGER ZONE

Notes:

even though the contents of the commits we're moving haven't changed,

the code they're based on is different

so the SHAs are different

## Merging vs rebasing

IMAGE: merging
IMAGE: rebasing

Notes:

when we say "move the branch head" we mean rebasing

merging applies the other branch to the end of this one, as a new "merge commit"

rebasing is like winding the wheel of git back a few turns, then checking out a different commit, then letting the wheel spin back forward

Trail: Moving commits,Rebasing a branch ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Resolution

- `git rebase some-identifier`

Notes:

- identifier can be a branch name, a SHA, a tag, a relative reference like HEAD~2....

- new changes have been merged to main and I want my branch based on latest ü§ó
